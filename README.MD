Gallery

Intended and themed to be an artistic platform, Gallery is an app that allows users to create a custom gallery of images from the web without relying on the cumbersome local storage requirements that images usually take up.

The App has been constructed using React Native in npm with the packages: StatusBar from expo-status-bar, useState, useEffect, and createContext from react, AsyncStorage from @react-native-async-storage/async-storage, createNativeStackNavigator from @react-navigation/native-stack, and StyleSheet, Text, View, Button, Image, TextInput, FlatList, ImageBackground, TouchableOpacity, and Linking from react-native.
